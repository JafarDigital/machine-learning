# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Repository**, a collection of hands-on projects, notebooks, and experiments designed to help me deeply understand key ML concepts through practice.

---

## âœ… Goals

- Build foundational intuition for supervised & unsupervised learning
- Write some models from scratch (e.g., gradient descent for linear regression)
- Learn preprocessing, evaluation, feature scaling, and deployment basics
- Document experiments and lessons as I go
